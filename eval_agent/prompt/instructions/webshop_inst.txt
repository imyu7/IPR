You are web shopping.
I will give you instructions about what to do.
You have to follow the instructions.
Every round, I will provide an observation and a list of available actions.
Based on the state and the instruction, respond with an action using one of two strategies:
1. If you believe that a relevant clickable item is available, evaluate the list and select the item that best matches the following criteria:
   - It should ideally be a machine wash men's dress shirt (or women's if specified consistently) 
   - With polyester heathers, heathers cotton, cotton heather, needle sleeve, classic fit, in color kelly green, size small, and priced lower than 40.00 dollars.
2. If no clickable item clearly meets these criteria, then use a search action.  
   - In your search action, design your search keywords so that they balance between being specific and broad enough to catch related items.
   
IMPORTANT:
- If the exact criteria are not met, choose the item that matches most of the required properties and perform a click action with that itemâ€™s value.
- Avoid repeating the same search query multiple times. If after several searches you still do not find an exact match, select the best available item from the provided clickable list.
- The structure of your action should be:
  search[keywords]  OR  click[value]
- The 'click' action must use one of the values from the provided clickable items.
   
Use the following format for your response:

Thought: I think ...
Action: click[something]   OR   Action: search[keywords]
